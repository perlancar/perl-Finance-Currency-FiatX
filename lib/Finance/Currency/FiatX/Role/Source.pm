=head1 DESCRIPTION

All routines must return enveloped result.

 [$status, $reason, $payload, \%extra]

This result is analogous to an HTTP response; in fact $status mostly uses HTTP
response codes. C<$reason> is analogous to HTTP status message. C<$payload> is
the actual content (optional if C<$status> is error status). C<%extra> is
optional and analogous to HTTP response headers to specify flags or attributes
or other metadata.

Some examples of enveloped result:

 [200, "OK", 14000]
 [404, "Not found"]

For more details about enveloped result, see L<Rinci::function>.


=head1 REQUIRED ROUTINES

=head2 get_all_spot_rates

Usage:

 get_all_spot_rates() -> [$status, $reason, $payload [ , \%extra ] ]

Return spot rates for all currency pairs and all rate types available from this
source. If the source provides a way to list all supported rates in a single API
call or webpage, then this routine should return them. Otherwise, this routine
should return status 501, e.g.

 [501, "Source does not offer a way to list all spot rates at once"]

Result payload is an array of hashes, where each hash must contain these keys:
C<pair> (str in the format of C<< <from_currency>/<to_currency> >>, e.g.
C<USD/IDR>), C<rate> (num, the rate), C<mtime> (Unix epoch, last updated time
for the rate, according to the source). C<type> ("buy" or "sell" or "buy_XXX" or
"sell_XXX" where XXX is some type of rate, e.g. "buy_er" for e-Rate buy rate, or
"sell_bn" or bank note sell rate. At the very least, "buy" and "sell" should be
supported; if the source has different types of buy-sell rates, one should be
picked as the default "buy" and "sell"). Hash can also contain these optional
keys: C<note> (str).

=head2 get_spot_rate

Return spot (the latest) rate for a currency pair and a specific rate type.

Usage:

 get_spot_rate(%args) -> [$status, $reason, $payload [ , \%extra ] ]

Example:

 get_spot_rate(from => "USD", to => "IDR", type => "sell");
 # => [200, "OK", {rate=>14100, mtime=>1530075306, }]

Arguments:

=over

=item * from

Required. Currency code.

=item * to

Required. Currency code.

=item * type

Required. String. Either "buy" or "sell" or "buy_XXX" or "sell_XXX" (see
L</"get_all_spot_rates"> for more details.

=back

If a source does not support the currency pair, routine must return status 501.
If the curerncy pair is supported but the type is unknown, routine must also
return status 501.

Result payload is hash that must contain these keys: C<pair> (str in the format
of C<< <from_currency>/<to_currency> >>, e.g. C<USD/IDR>), C<rate> (num, the
rate), C<mtime> (Unix epoch, last updated time for the rate, according to the
source). C<type> ("buy" or "sell" or "buy_XXX" or "sell_XXX"). Hash can also
contain these optional keys: C<note>.

=head2 TODO: get_historical_rates

Usage:

 get_historical_rates(%args) -> [$status, $reason, $payload [ , \%extra ] ]

Arguments:

=over

=item * from

Required. Currency code.

=item * to

Required. Currency code.

=item * from_date

Required. Date as Unix epoch (UTC).

=item * to_date

Required. Date as Unix epoch (UTC).

=item * frequency

Required. String. Either "daily" or "weekly" etc.

=back

If source does not support historical rates, routine must return status 501
response, e.g.:

 [501, "Source does not offer historical rates"]
